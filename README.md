# 🗳️ E-Voting System in C

##  Project Overview

The **E-Voting System** is a console-based application developed in the C programming language that simulates a simple electronic voting process. The system allows an administrator to set up an election, voters to register and cast their votes, and users to view election results.

The project demonstrates the practical implementation of core C programming concepts such as structures, file handling, dynamic memory allocation, functions, pointers, and modular programming.

## 📋 Workflow

1. Admin creates an election.
2. Candidates are stored in `candidate.txt`.
3. Voters register using a unique voter ID.
4. Voter details are stored in `voters.txt`.
5. Registered voters cast their votes.
6. The system prevents multiple voting attempts.
7. Results are generated and displayed.

---

## 🔒 Voting Rules

* Each voter must have a unique Voter ID.
* A voter can vote only once.
* Duplicate voting is not allowed.
* Votes are recorded permanently in files.

## 📸 Sample Menu

```text
1. ADMIN
2. REGISTER AS VOTER AND VOTE
3. VIEW RESULTS
4. EXIT
```
